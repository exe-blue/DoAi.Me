# Archive policy

- **When to archive**: Move to `_archive/` (e.g. `_archive/docs/` or `_archive/<topic>/`) when a doc is unused or superseded by a new version. List each move in [docs/DOCS_MANAGER_UPDATES.md](./DOCS_MANAGER_UPDATES.md) under the run’s “Files archived” table.
- **Rule**: Archived documents must **not** be opened or used for current development unless explicitly needed (e.g. debugging a regression or comparing with an old version). Normal work must use only current/active docs (Critical / High / Reference tiers in DOCS_MANAGER_UPDATES).
